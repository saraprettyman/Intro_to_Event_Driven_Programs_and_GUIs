**Programming Language(s) Used**
JavaScript, CSS, HTML

**Objective** 
Build an application that allows for exporting HTML files created by the user's inputs. Additionally, implement the principles of accessibility for web applications. 

**Task**
Create receipe cards by allowing the user to add a recipe title, ingredients, and instructions. Give the user the flexibility to delete ingredients by clicking on them and by keyboard shortcuts. Similarly, give the user the flexibility to do the same with saving the recipe card. The recipe card should contain the whole HTML code, JavaScript, and CSS necessary to display it. 

**Implementation**
Initially, focus on the user interface of the index page. Ensuring that there are 3 inputs, each with the proper accessibility features, allow items to be added by the inputs and storage. Add additinoal features such as removing items, both from the UI and from the temporary storage. Ensure that the Reset button resets more than just the UI but also the recipe card that was in the creation process. Next, make sure the save button creates the proper recipe card using the given writeRecipeToFile.js file from the professor. Lastly, go through the motions of creating a recipe with and without the accessibility features to ensure the process is aestetically pleasing and accessibiltiy friendly.
