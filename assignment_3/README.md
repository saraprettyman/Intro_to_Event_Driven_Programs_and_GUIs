**Programming Language(s) Used**

**Objective** 
Gain familiarity with CSS and how to implement it with a HTML file. 

**Task**
Create a general education/employment resume. Include each level of education, and each prior work experience along with a brief description of the position. Also, include at least 7 programming languages. 


**Implementation**
In the CSS file, color, fonts, flex-boxes, and proper spaces were included. Many of the styling was relatively general, so classes and ids were included to simply the required code. The included font file, AmaticSC-Bold is from Google's open source font library. See OFL.txt for permissions. The icons were taken from Icons8's free design elements page.
