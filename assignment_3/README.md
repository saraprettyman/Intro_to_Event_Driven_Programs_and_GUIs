# Assignment 3
**Programming Language(s) Used**   
CSS, HTML

**Objective**   
Gain familiarity with CSS and how to implement it alongside an HTML file. 

**Task**   
Create a general education/employment resume. Include each level of education, and each prior work experience along with a brief description of the position. Also, include at least 7 programming languages. 


**Implementation**   
This was completed by creating a CSS file and introducing color, fonts, flex-boxes, and proper spaces. Many of the styling was relatively generic, so classes and IDs were included to simplify the required code. Google's AmaticSC-Bold from their open source font library was utilized. See [OFL.txt](OFL.txt) for licensing and permission details. The icons were taken from Icons8's free design elements page.
