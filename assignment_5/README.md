**Programming Language(s) Used**
JavaScript, CSS, HTML

**Objective** 
Using CSS and JavaScript, apply motion to UI elements and make them interactable. 

**Task**
Create the following components: Navbar, Navigation Drawer, Button, Floating Action Button, Image Carousel, and Loading Spinners. For each component, create a library documenting the code for it. Provide the links for each component in the Navigation Drawer. 

**Implementation**
The NavBar is the first item to create. Add 3 example page links, a title, and Navigation Menu button. Next, create the navigation drawer. Using CSS and JavaScript, make the navigation menu button interactable. It will fade when selected. The navigation bar will contain 6 links, each referring the library of the components code. \
Next, show the difference of button types: one with an icon, one with out. Immediately below, show a complex JavaScript application for the image carousel. This carousel shows 3 images slide by at a time, a constant flow of the same 6 or 7 images without breaks.\
After, show the first of the three Loading spinners. The first is to be a text flowing seemlessly across the screen. Next, a loading spinner implemented with simple CSS. The last spinner is to be interactable. Hovering over the Loading spinner shows the instructions which state "Click to attempt to get the gray on green" with the gray consistently spinning around the circle. Once clicked the gray stops on the screen and can be played over and over again. This is created primarily using CSS animation.\
Last is a Floating Action Button. Hover your mouse over it to see it react and become more prominent on the screen.
