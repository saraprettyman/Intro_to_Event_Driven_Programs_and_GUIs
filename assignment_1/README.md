**Programming Language(s) Used**
JavaScript, HTML

**Objective**
The object of this assignment was to gain a foundation of JavaScript functions and syntax. Specifically, it was to be able to implement and use Higher Order Functions and familiarize oneself with the developer tool's console log.

**Task**
From the JavaScript data file, identify the total invalid transations (invalid if amount is $0, null, or undefined), total duplicate customers, the most recent transations over $200, the varying size of transations, and which customers have at least one transaction over $200.

**Implementation**
This was done by filtering the data, finding the last value in an array, maping a new array, creating arrays based off of pairIf clauses, and more. The results are to be displayed in the console log at run time.
