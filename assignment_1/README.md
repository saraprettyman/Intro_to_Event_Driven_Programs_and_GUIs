# Assignment 1
**Programming Language(s) Used**   
JavaScript, HTML

**Objective**   
The object of this assignment was to gain a foundation of JavaScript functions and syntax. Specifically, it was to be able to implement and use Higher Order Functions and familiarize oneself with the developer tool's console log.

**Task**   
From the provided JavaScript data file, identify the total invalid transations (i.e., when the amount is $0, null, or undefined), total duplicate customers, the most recent transations over $200, the varying size of transations, and which customers have at least one transaction over $200.

**Implementation**   
This was completed by filtering the data, finding the last value in an array, mapping a new array, creating arrays based off of pairIf clauses, and more. The results are displayed in the console log at run time.
