**Programming Language(s) Used**
JavaScript, HTML

**Objective** 
Using JavaScript with HTML, create a application basic GUI application based on event-driven programming. 

**Task**
Design a MadLib creator that only accepts certain inputs, and requires all input boxes to be filled. Prompt user for at least 5 words, and create the story template yourself. Allow the user to generate a new store, using the same origin template but with different input this time.\
On another page, create a Mortage calculate that auto generates the estimated monthly loan payment as soon as the loan amount, annual interest rate, and number of years is added. Each time a single value is changed, update the monthly charge.



**Implementation**
Create an individual JavaScript and HTML file for each page, and allow there to be a main index.html page. To calculate the MadLib, use a simple if-else format for the generator button so that it can properly identify which word is missing. For the mortgage calculator, add event listeners to identify when the input boxes are out of focus.
