# Assignment 2
**Programming Language(s) Used**   
JavaScript, HTML

**Objective**   
Using JavaScript with HTML, create a application basic GUI application based on event-driven programming. 

**Task**   
Design a MadLib generator that only accepts certain inputs, and requires all input boxes to be filled. Prompt the user for at least 5 words, and create an original story template. Allow the user to generate a new story, using the same initial template but allow the user to insert new inputs.   

On another page, create a Mortage calculator that auto generates the estimated monthly loan payment as soon as the loan amount, annual interest rate, and number of years is added. Each time a single value is changed, update the monthly charge.

**Implementation**   
This was completed by creating an individual JavaScript and HTML file for each page with a main index.html page. For calculating the MadLib, a simple if-else format was utilized for the generator button to properly identify which word is missing. For the mortgage calculator, an event listener was added to identify when the input boxes are out of focus.
